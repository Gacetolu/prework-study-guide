# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.
# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
I created this Prework study guide in order to make it easir to organise my notes throughout my Front end dev bootcamp. This also allows me to easiy access them whenever i need and helps save time.
While creating this study guide webpage i learnt the basics about HTML, CSS, JavaScrit and Git flow.
The simple and readable layout of the projects makes it easy to understand my notes.

## Usage

The study guide can be used to make learning all the information on the bootcamp easier. 
Each section of the guide contains notes about a certain topic such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
If the DevTools console is opened, we can see the JavaScript running.
It will also list the topics learnt from prework and choose one topic to study.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
